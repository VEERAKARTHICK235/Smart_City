🏙️ Smart City Project Dashboard
This project is a 100% software-based simulation of a Smart City management dashboard. It uses various machine learning models to analyze data and provide insights for different urban modules, all presented through an interactive web interface built with Streamlit.

## ✨ Features
This dashboard simulates the following smart city modules:

🚦 Smart Traffic Control: Predicts traffic volume using a Gradient Boosting model to suggest traffic light timing adjustments.

🗑️ Smart Waste Management: Uses a Linear Model to predict bin fill levels and optimize collection routes.

🌬️ Air Quality Monitoring: Forecasts future Air Quality Index (AQI) using an LSTM time-series model.

💧 Smart Water Management: Detects anomalies like leaks in water consumption data using an Isolation Forest model.

⚡ Smart Energy Grid: Forecasts energy demand using an LSTM time-series model to help manage the power grid.

🚓 Public Safety (CCTV): Simulates object detection (YOLOv8) on uploaded CCTV frames to identify people, cars, etc.

🚗 Smart Parking: Predicts parking spot availability using Logistic Regression.

📣 Citizen Feedback Portal: Performs sentiment analysis on citizen feedback to categorize and prioritize responses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.9+

Web Framework: Streamlit

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

NLP: Hugging Face Transformers

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
